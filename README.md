# Web-Blocker
Python Web Blocker
Overview
The Python Web Blocker is a project aimed at helping users to stay focused by blocking distracting websites on their devices. Users can input a list of websites they wish to block, and upon clicking the block button, the program checks if the websites are already blocked. If not, it proceeds to block them and notifies the user.
Features
Key Features
	•	Block multiple websites simultaneously.
	•	Check if websites are already blocked before attempting to block them.
	•	Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy interaction.
	•	Utilizes Tkinter module for creating the GUI interface.
	•	Simplified user experience with the ability to easily input website links to be blocked.
	•	Uses function definitions to streamline code structure.

Design and Implementation Highlights
	•	Graphical User Interface: The program employs a GUI developed using the Tkinter module, enhancing user experience and making interaction intuitive.
	•	Simplified Input: Users can easily input website links to be blocked, making the process straightforward and efficient.
	•	Function Definitions: Python's function definition capability is utilized to structure the code effectively, improving readability and maintainability.

Known Issues
File Path Definition
	•	Issue: The program encounters a problem with defining the host path in the {C} drive for laptops, as the file location may not exist, or access to system files might be restricted.
	•	Resolution: To address this issue, a new file is created in disk W, ensuring the program can access its location and save modifications.

Resolution Process
	•	Identification: The issue was identified when the program failed to execute despite multiple attempts.
	•	Troubleshooting: Several attempts were made to identify the problem, including consulting experienced individuals.
	•	Resolution: After thorough investigation, it was determined that the file path definition was the root cause of the problem.
	•	Implementation: To fix the issue, a new file path was specified in disk W, allowing the program to function correctly.

Suggestions for Future Development
	•	Enhanced File Handling: Implement advanced file handling techniques to improve file access and modification capabilities.
	•	Customizable Blocking Schedule: Introduce functionality to allow users to set specific times for website blocking, enabling tailored distraction management.
	•	User Profiles: Incorporate user profiles to save individual preferences and configurations for personalized usage.
	•	Whitelist Feature: Include an option for users to whitelist certain websites that should not be blocked, offering flexibility in website management.
